    <p><strong>March 20, 1951, IRAN MAJLIS PARLIMENT NATIONALIZES OIL INDUSTRY; Brits claim this is a “threat to the security of the world.”</strong><br /></p>
      The Ayatollah Begs to Differ; the Paradox of Modern Iran, by Hooman Majd, 2008, page 234-235, “Iranians are often adroitly reminded by their leaders that when their soon-to-be-deposed prime minister Mossadeq nationalized the Iranian oil industry, in effect demanding their right to profits from their own oil, the British responded publicly, and at the UN no less, that Iran’s exercise of its right was a “threat to the security of world,” words that have been repeated by the United States in response to Iran exercising its right, haq, as far as Iranians are concerned, to produce nuclear fuel.”<br />
      The New York Times, March 9, 1951, Teheran, Iran, “Nationalizing of Oil in Iran Asked; Slain Premier, Plan's Foe, Buried; IRANIAN UNIT ASKS OIL NATIONALIZING - A Parliamentary committee voted unanimously for nationalization of the oil industry tonight, a few hours after the funeral of Premier Gen. Ali Razmara, who was assassinated yesterday because he had opposed the plan."</dd>

It was the first time a prime minister had been chosen without the shah’s approval.  Mossadegh had two goals: To create a parliamentary democracy, to reduce the shah’s power, and to wrest control of Iran’s oil from the British.”</dd>

    <p><strong>January 7, 1952, 1951 MAN OF THE YEAR, The Iranian George Washington</strong><br /></p>
      Time Magazine, January 7, 1952, 1951 MAN OF THE YEAR; Mohammed Mossadegh - He Oiled the Wheels of Chaos - The U.S. …wanted to feel sympathy toward the aspirations of Asian peoples. After all, material progress and national independence are both classic American doctrines, and the U.S. could envision itself as playing Lafayette to Asian George Washingtons. But in terms of Asian realities, … the U.S. was appalled by the facts. Just as it had recoiled from Nationalist China, crying "Corruption," so in 1951 the U.S. recoiled from the corruption, hatred, fanaticism and disorganization of the Middle East.  Mossadegh, by Western standards an appalling caricature of a statesman, was a fair sample of what the West would have to work with in the Middle East. To sit back and deplore him was to run away from the issue. For a long time, relations with the Middle East would mean relations with men such as Mossadegh, some better, some much worse.  The Iranian George Washington was probably born in 1879 (he fibs about his age)... </dd>
